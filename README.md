# Exploring Pokémon Legends: Arceus reviews

**Pokémon Legends: Arceus** was released on January 28th, 2022 with a big promise: to change the pokémon formula. The games have been around since 1996 and together are the [highest-grossing video game franchise](https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/lifestyle/the-top-50-highest-grossing-video-game-franchises/) today. Ever since that first contact with the amazing Pokémon Red/Blue, fans have mostly seen the same game concept in all mainline games: some young trainer taking on a villain team as she/he journeys to become the pokémon league champion. The battling and catching mechanics have changed very little and newer games have made an effort to make training easier and faster (*back in the day you could only exp. share with one pokémon at a time!*).

So, when Legends: Arceus was [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2zj0y6GFq8&ab_channel=NintendoWire) the pokémon world was full of expectations. A new game with an open-world concept, dynamic catching mechanics and actual battling going on (as opposed to the [Pokémon Let's Go games](https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/)). However, the fans [were not happy about the visuals](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-graphics-controversy-explained/) of the game. A lot has been said about this game's graphics and how it just doesn't compare with modern open-world games.

Now, over two months after release, we are going to explore Pokémon Legends: Arceus reviews from [metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/pokemon-legends-arceus/user-reviews?sort-by=score&num_items=100) and try to analyze a little of what users are saying about the game. The reviews were scraped using our [scraper](scraper.py) on March 19, 2022.

## Files to check out:

* [Scraping.ipynb](Scraping.ipynb): this is the notebook where all the testing is done to build the scraper. Note that it is unorganized!

* [scraper.py](scraper.py): this is the actual scraper to use. NOTE: you can easily change the `url` in `main()` to reuse this scraper for any other game in metacritic (subject to testing).

* [EDA.ipynb](EDA.ipynb): this is where all the analysis is done. I use pandas, spacy and plotly to explore user reviews. To get a feel into user sentiment, I use VADER to compare the predicted sentiment with the given score. Two bonuses at the end of the file: getting all of our data processing into a single pandas pipe and a cool looking word cloud for our dataset.
